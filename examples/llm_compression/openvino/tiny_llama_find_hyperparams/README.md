# Find the appropriate hyperparameters to compress the TinyLLama model

This example demonstrates how to find the appropriate `awq`, `ratio` and `group_size` parameters to compress the weights of the TinyLLama model from the HuggingFace Transformers. OpenVINO backend supports inference of mixed-precision models with weights compressed to a 4-bit data type as a primary precision. The fastest mixed-precision mode is `INT4_SYM`, but it may lead to a significant accuracy degradation, especially for models of moderate size. In this example, the allowed maximum deviation from the original model is `0.2` points of the similarity metric. If the similarity of the compressed model is not satisfying, there are 3 hyper-parameters to tune: `awq`, `group_size` and `ratio`. Smaller `group_size` and `ratio` of 4-bit layers usually improve accuracy at the sacrifice of model size and inference latency. Generally, the accuracy of the 4-bit compressed models also can be improved by using AWQ algorithm over data-based mixed-precision algorithm.
To evaluate the accuracy of the compressed model we measure similarity between two texts generated by the baseline and compressed models using [WhoWhatBench](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino.genai/tree/master/llm_bench/python/who_what_benchmark) library.

The example includes the following steps:

- Prepare `wikitext` dataset.
- Prepare `TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-step-50K-105b` text-generation model in OpenVINO representation using [Optimum-Intel](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/intel/inference).
- Compress weights of the model with NNCF Weight compression algorithm.
- Find appropriate `awq`, `ratio` and `group_size` if acceptable similarity is not achieved.
- Measure the similarity and footprint of the final model.

## Install requirements

To run the example you should install the corresponding Python dependencies:

- Create a separate Python* environment and activate it: `python3 -m venv nncf_env && source nncf_env/bin/activate`
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U pip
pip install ../../../../
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Example

The example is fully automated. Just run the following command in the prepared Python environment:

```bash
python main.py
```

To find the appropriate `awq`, `ratio` and `group_size` parameters for your HF model, change the `model_id`, `dataset` and `transform_func`.
Please refer to the `<YOUR ...>` comments in `main.py` to find the exact places that should be modified.
