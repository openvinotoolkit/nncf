# here is restricted with respect to the classes it can load, to safeguard
# against attacks described above.
# ** WARNING **: there is no final guarantee that using this module in
# conjunction with torch.load mitigates all possible routes of arbitrary code
# execution attacks possible while using Python's `pickle`.
# ** Only load the data you trust **
