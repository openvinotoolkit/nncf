# Object Detection sample

This sample demonstrates DL model compression capabilities for object detection task.

## Features

- Vanilla SSD300 / SSD512 (+ Batch Normalization), MobileNetSSD-300
- VOC2007 / VOC2012, COCO datasets
- Configuration file examples for sparsity, quantization, filter pruning and quantization with sparsity
- Export to ONNX compatible with OpenVINO (compatible with pre-shipped CPU extensions detection layers)
- DataParallel and DistributedDataParallel modes
- Tensorboard output

## Installation

At this point it is assumed that you have already installed nncf. You can find information on downloading nncf [here](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf#user-content-installation).

To work with the sample you should install the corresponding Python package dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r examples/torch/requirements.txt
```

## Quantize FP32 pretrained model

This scenario demonstrates quantization with fine-tuning of SSD300 on VOC dataset.

### Dataset preparation

- Download and extract in one folder train/val+test VOC2007 and train/val VOC2012 data from [here](https://pjreddie.com/projects/pascal-voc-dataset-mirror/)
- In the future, `<path_to_dataset>` means the path to this folder.

### Run object detection sample

- If you did not install the package then add the repository root folder to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable
- Navigate to the `examples/torch/object_detection` folder
- (Optional) Before compressing a model, it is highly recommended checking the accuracy of the pretrained model, use the following command:

  ```bash
  python main.py \
  --mode=test \
  --config=configs/ssd300_vgg_voc_int8.json \
  --data=<path_to_dataset> \
  --disable-compression
  ```

- Run the following command to start compression with fine-tuning on GPUs:
  `python main.py -m train --config configs/ssd300_vgg_voc_int8.json --data <path_to_dataset> --log-dir=../../results/quantization/ssd300_int8 --weights=<path_to_checkpoint>`It may take a few epochs to get the baseline accuracy results.
- Use `--weights` flag with the path to a compatible PyTorch checkpoint in order to load all matching weights from the checkpoint into the model - useful if you need to start compression-aware training from a previously trained uncompressed (FP32) checkpoint instead of performing compression-aware training from scratch. This flag is optional, but highly recommended to use.
- Use `--multiprocessing-distributed` flag to run in the distributed mode.
- Use `--resume` flag with the path to a previously saved model to resume training.
- Use the `--no_strip_on_export` to export not stripped model.

### Validate your model checkpoint

To estimate the test scores of your trained model checkpoint use the following command:
`python main.py -m test --config=configs/ssd300_vgg_voc_int8.json --data <path_to_dataset> --resume <path_to_trained_model_checkpoint>`
If you want to validate an FP32 model checkpoint, make sure the compression algorithm settings are empty in the configuration file or `pretrained=True` is set.

**WARNING**: The samples use `torch.load` functionality for checkpoint loading which, in turn, uses pickle facilities by default which are known to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution attacks. **Only load the data you trust**

### Export compressed model

To export trained model to ONNX format use the following command:
`python main.py -m export --config configs/ssd300_vgg_voc_int8.json --data <path_to_dataset> --resume <path_to_compressed_model_checkpoint> --to-onnx=../../results/ssd300_int8.onnx`

### Export to OpenVINO Intermediate Representation (IR)

To export a model to OpenVINO IR and run it using Intel Deep Learning Deployment Toolkit please refer to this [tutorial](https://software.intel.com/en-us/openvino-toolkit).
