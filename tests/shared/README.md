This folder contains test code that is meant to be reused in more than one backend-specific (or agnostic) test subfolder, such as reusable fixtures, parsers, comparators etc.
No test cases themselves should be stored here.

For test cases that validate NNCF's common, framework-agnostic code, see the "common" folder.
