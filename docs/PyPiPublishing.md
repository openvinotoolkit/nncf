# Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF)

Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF) provides a suite of post-training
and training-time algorithms for optimizing inference of neural networks in
[OpenVINO&trade;](https://docs.openvino.ai) with a minimal accuracy drop.

NNCF is designed to work with models from [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/),
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) and
[OpenVINO&trade;](https://docs.openvino.ai).

The framework is organized as a Python package that can be built and used
as a standalone tool. Its architecture is unified to make adding different
compression algorithms easy for both PyTorch and TensorFlow.

NNCF provides samples that demonstrate the usage of compression algorithms
for different use cases and models. See compression results achievable
with the NNCF-powered samples on the
[NNCF Model Zoo page](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/ModelZoo.md).
