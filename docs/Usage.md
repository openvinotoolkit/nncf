# Use Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF) as Standalone

This is a step-by-step tutorial on how to integrate the NNCF package into the existing project.
The use case implies that the user already has a training pipeline that reproduces training of the model in the floating  point precision and pretrained model.
The task is to prepare this model for accelerated inference by simulating the compression at train time.
The instructions below use certain "helper" functions of the NNCF which abstract away most of the framework specifics and make the integration easier in most cases.
As an alternative, you can always use the NNCF internal objects and methods as described in the [architectural overview](./NNCFArchitecture.md).


## Basic usage

#### Step 1: Create an NNCF configuration file

A JSON configuration file is used for easier setup of the parameters of compression to be applied to your model.
See [configuration file description](./ConfigFile.md) or the sample configuration files packaged with the [example scripts](../examples) for reference.

#### Step 2: Modify the training pipeline
NNCF enables compression-aware training by being integrated into the regular training pipelines.
The framework is designed so that the modifications to your original training code are minor.

 1. **Add** the imports required for NNCF:
    ```python
    import torch
    import nncf.torch  # Important - must be imported before any other external package that depends on torch
    from nncf import NNCFConfig, create_compressed_model, load_state
    ```
    **NOTE (PyTorch)**: Due to the way NNCF works within the PyTorch backend, `import nncf` must be done before any other import of `torch` in your package _or_ in third-party packages that your code utilizes, otherwise the compression may be applied incompletely.
 2. Load the NNCF JSON configuration file that you prepared during Step 1:
    ```python
    nncf_config = NNCFConfig.from_json("nncf_config.json")  # Specify a path to your own NNCF configuration file in place of "nncf_config.json"
    ```
 3. (Optional) For certain algorithms such as quantization it is highly recommended to **initialize the algorithm** by
 passing training data via `nncf_config` prior to starting the compression fine-tuning properly:
    ```python
    from nncf import register_default_init_args
    nncf_config = register_default_init_args(nncf_config, train_loader, criterion=criterion)
    ```
    Training data loaders should be attached to the NNCFConfig object as part of a library-defined structure. `register_default_init_args` is a helper
    method that registers the necessary structures for all available initializations (currently quantizer range and precision initialization) by taking
    data loader, criterion and criterion function (for sophisticated calculation of loss different from direct call of the
    criterion with 2 arguments: model outputs and targets).

    The initialization expects that the model is called with its first argument equal to the dataloader output.
    If your model has more complex input arguments you can create your own data loader implementing
    `nncf.common.initialization.dataloader.NNCFDataLoader` interface to return a tuple of (_single model input_ , _the rest of the model inputs as a kwargs dict_).

 4. Right after you create an instance of the original model and load its weights, **wrap the model** by making the following call
    ```python
    compression_ctrl, compressed_model = create_compressed_model(model, nncf_config)
    ```
    The `create_compressed_model` function parses the loaded configuration file and returns two objects. `compression_ctrl` is a "controller" object that can be used during compressed model training to adjust certain parameters of the compression algorithm (according to a scheduler, for instance), or to gather statistics related to your compression algorithm (such as the current level of sparsity in your model).

 5. (Optional) Wrap your model with `DataParallel` or `DistributedDataParallel` classes for multi-GPU training.
If you use `DistributedDataParallel`, add the following call afterwards:
   ```python
   compression_ctrl.distributed()
   ```

   in case the compression algorithms that you use need special adjustments to function in the distributed mode.


6. In the **training loop**, make the following changes:
     - After inferring the model, take a compression loss and add it (using the `+` operator) to the common loss, for example cross-entropy loss:
        ```python
        compression_loss = compression_ctrl.loss()
        loss = cross_entropy_loss + compression_loss
        ```
     - Call the scheduler `step()` before each training iteration:
        ```python
        compression_ctrl.scheduler.step()
        ```
     - Call the scheduler `epoch_step()` before each training epoch:
        ```python
        compression_ctrl.scheduler.epoch_step()
        ```

> **NOTE**: For a real-world example of how these changes should be introduced, take a look at the [examples](../examples) published in the NNCF repository.

#### Step 3: Run the training pipeline
At this point, the NNCF is fully integrated into your training pipeline.
You can run it as usual and monitor your original model's metrics and/or compression algorithm metrics and balance model metrics quality vs. level of compression.


Important points you should consider when training your networks with compression algorithms:
  - Turn off the `Dropout` layers (and similar ones like `DropConnect`) when training a network with quantization or sparsity
  - It is better to turn off additional regularization in the loss function (for example, L2 regularization via `weight_decay`) when training the network with RB sparsity, since it already imposes an L0 regularization term.

#### Step 4 (optional): Export the compressed model to ONNX
After the compressed model has been fine-tuned to acceptable accuracy and compression stages, you can export it to ONNX format.
Since export process is in general algorithm-specific, you have to call the compression controller's `export_model` method to properly export the model with compression specifics into ONNX:
```python
compression_ctrl.export_model("./compressed_model.onnx")
```
The exported ONNX file may contain special, non-ONNX-standard operations and layers to leverage full compressed/low-precision potential of the OpenVINO toolkit.
In some cases it is possible to export a compressed model with ONNX standard operations only (so that it can be run using `onnxruntime`, for example) - this is the case for the 8-bit symmetric quantization and sparsity/filter pruning algorithms.
Refer to [compression algorithm documentation](./compression_algorithms) for details.

## Saving and loading compressed models
The complete information about compression is defined by a compressed model and a compression state.
The model characterizes the weights and topology of the network. The compression state - how to restore the setting of 
compression layers in the model and how to restore the compression schedule and the compression loss.
The latter can be obtained by `compression_ctrl.get_compression_state()` on saving and passed to the 
`create_compressed_model` helper function by the optional `compression_state` argument on loading. 
The compressed model should be loaded once it's created.

Saving and loading of the compressed model and compression state is framework-specific and can be done in an arbitrary 
way. NNCF provides one possible way of doing it with helper functions in samples.

To save the best compressed checkpoint use `compression_ctrl.compression_stage()` to distinguish between 3 possible
levels of compression: `UNCOMPRESSED`, `PARTIALLY_COMPRESSED` and `FULLY_COMPRESSED`. It is useful in case of `staged` 
compression. Model may achieve the best accuracy on earlier stages of compression - tuning without compression or with 
intermediate compression rate, but still fully compressed model with lower accuracy should be considered as the best 
compressed one. `UNCOMPRESSED` means that no compression is applied for the model, for instance, in case of stage 
quantization - when all quantization are disabled, or in case of sparsity - when current sparsity rate is zero. 
`PARTIALLY_COMPRESSED` stands for the compressed model which haven't reached final compression ratio yet, e.g. magnitude
sparsity algorithm has learnt masking of 30% weights out of 51% of target rate. The controller returns 
`FULLY_COMPRESSED` compression stage when it finished scheduling and tuning hyper parameters of the compression 
algorithm, for example when rb-sparsity method sets final target sparsity rate for the loss.

### Saving and loading compressed models in TensorFlow
```python
# save part
compression_ctrl, compress_model = create_compressed_model(model, nncf_config)
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=compress_model,
                                 compression_state=TFCompressionState(compression_ctrl),
                                 ...)

# save checkpoint in a preferable way
    # using checkpoint manager
    checkpoint_manager = tf.train.CheckpointManager(checkpoint, path_to_checkpoint)
    checkpoint_manager.save()
    # or via the corresponding callback
    callbacks = []
    callbacks.append(CheckpointManagerCallback(checkpoint, ckpt_dir))
    ...
    compress_model.fit(..., callbacks=callbacks)

# load part
checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(compression_state=TFCompressionStateLoader())
checkpoint.restore(path_to_checkpoint)
compression_state = checkpoint.compression_state.state

compression_ctrl, compress_model = create_compressed_model(model, nncf_config, compression_state)

checkpoint = tf.train.Checkpoint(model=compress_model,
                                 ...)
checkpoint.restore(path_to_checkpoint)
```

Since the compression state is a dictionary of Python JSON-serializable objects, we convert it to JSON 
string within `tf.train.Checkpoint`. There are 2 helper classes: `TFCompressionState` - for saving compression state and 
`TFCompressionStateLoader` - for loading.

### Saving and loading compressed models in PyTorch

Deprecated API
```python
# save part
compression_ctrl, compressed_model = create_compressed_model(model, nncf_config)
checkpoint = {
    'state_dict': compressed_model.state_dict(),
    'scheduler_state': compression_ctrl.scheduler.get_state(),
    'compression_stage': compression_ctrl.compression_stage(),
    ...
}
torch.save(checkpoint, path)

# load part
resuming_checkpoint = torch.load(path)
state_dict = resuming_checkpoint['state_dict'] 
compression_ctrl, compressed_model = create_compressed_model(model, nncf_config, resuming_state_dict=state_dict)
compression_ctrl.scheduler.load_state(resuming_checkpoint['scheduler_state'])
```

New API
```python
# save part
compression_ctrl, compressed_model = create_compressed_model(model, nncf_config)
checkpoint = {
    'state_dict': compressed_model.state_dict(),
    'compression_state': compression_ctrl.get_compression_state(),
    ...
}
torch.save(checkpoint, path)

# load part
resuming_checkpoint = torch.load(path)
compression_state = resuming_checkpoint['compression_state'] 
compression_ctrl, compressed_model = create_compressed_model(model, nncf_config, compression_state=compression_state)
state_dict = resuming_checkpoint['state_dict'] 

# load model in a preferable way
    load_state(compressed_model, state_dict, is_resume=True)     
    # or when execution mode on loading is the same as on saving: 
    # save and load in a single GPU mode or save and load in the (Distributed)DataParallel one, not in a mixed way  
    compressed_model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
```

You can save the `compressed_model` object `torch.save` as usual: via `state_dict` and `load_state_dict` methods. 
Alternatively, you can use the `nncf.load_state` function on loading. It will attempt to load a PyTorch state dict into 
a model by first stripping the irrelevant prefixes, such as `module.` or `nncf_module.`, from both the checkpoint and 
the model layer identifiers, and then do the matching between the layers.
Depending on the value of the `is_resume` argument, it will then fail if an exact match could not be made 
(when `is_resume == True`), or load the matching layer parameters and print a warning listing the mismatches 
(when `is_resume == False`). `is_resume=False` is most commonly used if you want to load the starting weights from an 
uncompressed model into a compressed model and `is_resume=True` is used when you want to evaluate a compressed 
checkpoint or resume compressed checkpoint training without changing the compression algorithm parameters.

The compression state can be directly pickled by `torch.save` as well, since it is a dictionary of Python objects.

In the previous releases of the NNCF, model can be loaded without compression state information 
by saving the model state dictionary `compressed_model.state_dict` and loading it via `nncf.load_state` and  
`compressed_model.load_state_dict` methods or using optional `resuming_state_dict` argument of the 
`create_compressed_model`.
This way of loading is deprecated, and we highly recommend to not use this way as it does not guarantee the exact loading
of compression model state for algorithms with sophisticated initialization - e.g. HAWQ and AutoQ. 
Also in this case, keep in mind that in order to load the resulting checkpoint file the `compressed_model` object should
have the same structure with regard to PyTorch module and parameters as it was when the checkpoint was saved.
In practice this means that you should use the same compression algorithms (i.e. the same NNCF configuration file) when 
loading a compressed model checkpoint. 


## Exploring the compressed model
After a `create_compressed_model` call, the NNCF log directory will contain visualizations of internal representations for the original, uncompressed model (`original_graph.dot`) and for the model with the compression algorithms applied (`compressed_graph.dot`).
These graphs form the basis for NNCF analyses of your model.
Below is the example of a LeNet network's `original_graph.dot` visualization:

![alt text](pics/lenet_original_graph.png)

Same model's `compressed_graph.dot` visualization for symmetric INT8 quantization:

![alt text](pics/lenet_compressed_graph.png)

Visualize these .dot files using Graphviz and browse through the visualization to validate that this representation correctly reflects your model structure.
Each node represents a single PyTorch function call - see [NNCFArchitecture.md](./NNCFArchitecture.md) section on graph tracing for details.
In case you need to exclude some parts of the model from being considered in one algorithm or another, you can use the labels of the `compressed_graph.dot` nodes (excluding the numerical ID in the beginning) and specify these (globally or per-algorithm) within the corresponding specific sections in [configuration file](./ConfigFile.md)
Regular expression matching is also possible for easier exclusion of certain node groups.
For instance, below is the same LeNet INT8 model as above, but with `"ignored_scopes": ["{re}.*RELU.*", "LeNet/NNCFConv2d[conv2]"]`:

![alt text](pics/lenet_compressed_graph_ignored.png)

Notice that all RELU operation outputs and the second convolution's weights are no longer quantized.


## Advanced usage

### Compression of custom modules
With no target model code modifications, NNCF only supports native PyTorch modules with respect to trainable parameter (weight) compressed, such as `torch.nn.Conv2d`
If your model contains a custom, non-PyTorch standard module with trainable weights that should be compressed, you can register it using the `@nncf.register_module` decorator:

```python
import nncf

@nncf.register_module(ignored_algorithms=[...])
class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ...):
        self.weight = torch.nn.Parameter(...)
    # ...
```

If registered module should be ignored by specific algorithms use `ignored_algorithms` parameter of decorator.

In the example above, the NNCF-compressed models that contain instances of `MyModule` will have the corresponding modules extended with functionality that will allow NNCF to quantize, sparsify or prune the `weight` parameter of `MyModule` before it takes part in `MyModule`'s `forward` calculation.

### Accuracy-Aware model training
NNCF has the capability to apply the model compression algorithms while satisfying the user-defined accuracy constraints. This is done by executing an internal custom accuracy-aware training loop, which also helps to automate away some of the manual hyperparameter search related to model training such as setting the total number of epochs, the target compression rate for the model, etc. There are two supported training loops. The first one is called [Early Exit Training](./accuracy_aware_model_training/EarlyExitTraining.md), which aims to finish fine-tuning when the accuracy drop criterion is reached. The second one is more sophisticated. It is targeted for the automated discovery of the compression rate for the model given that it satisfies the user-specified maximal tolerable accuracy drop due to compression. Its name is [Adaptive Compression Level Training](./accuracy_aware_model_training/AdaptiveCompressionTraining.md). Both training loops could be run with either PyTorch or TensorFlow backend with the same user interface(except for the TF case where the Keras API is used for training).

The following function is required to create the accuracy-aware training loop. One has to pass the `NNCFConfig` object and the compression controller (that is returned upon compressed model creation, see above).
```python
from nncf.common.accuracy_aware_training import create_accuracy_aware_training_loop
training_loop = create_accuracy_aware_training_loop(nncf_config, compression_ctrl)
```

In order to properly instantiate the accuracy-aware training loop, the user has to specify the 'accuracy_aware_training' section. 
This section fully depends on what Accuracy-Aware Training loop is being used. 
For more details about config of Adaptive Compression Level Training refer to [Adaptive Compression Level Training documentation](./accuracy_aware_model_training/AdaptiveCompressionTraining.md) and Early Exit Training refer to [Early Exit Training documentation](./accuracy_aware_model_training/EarlyExitTraining.md).

The training loop is launched by calling its `run` method. Before the start of the training loop, the user is expected to define several functions related to the training of the model and pass them as arguments to the `run` method of the training loop instance:

```python

def train_epoch_fn(compression_ctrl, model, **kwargs):
    '''
    A function that takes the compression controller and the
    compressed model instance and trains it for a single epoch.
    Optional arguments, that are packed into the kwargs dictionary
    unless explicitly specified as arguments, are the following:
    `optimizer` - the optimizer instance, if it is defined in the training
    pipeline; `lr_scheduler` - the learning rate scheduler instance, in case
    it is defined in the training pipeline and used during single-epoch training,
    e.g. to adjust the learning rate on every iteration; `epoch` - current epoch
    count (in case it is needed for logging). Other entities used in this function
    are expected to be supplied as nonlocal variables of the outer function scope
    (i.e. `train_epoch_fn` to be used as a closure, see training samples for examples).
    Note that all of the NNCF-related integration code should be in place inside of this
    function to properly execute compression-aware training.
    '''

def validate_fn(model, **kwargs):
    '''
    A function that takes the model, runs its evaluation on the validation set
    and returns the float value of the target accuracy metric. Defined similarly
    to the `train_epoch_fn` above. The optional argument is `epoch` - current epoch
    number, if required for logging.
    '''

def configure_optimizers_fn():
    '''
    An (optional) function that instantiates an optimizer and a learning rate
    scheduler before fine-tuning. Should be registered in all of the cases when
    an explicit optimizer/LR scheduler object is used for training. The `optimizer`
    and `lr_scheduler` arguments should be defined in the `train_epoch_fn` function
    in this case as well. The `configure_optimizers_fn` should return a tuple consisting
    of an optimizer instance and an LR scheduler instance (replace with None if the latter
    is not applicable).
    '''

def dump_checkpoint_fn(model, compression_controller, accuracy_aware_runner, save_dir):
    '''
    An (optional) function that allows a user to define how to save the model's checkpoint.
    Training loop will call this function instead own dump_checkpoint function and pass 
    `model`, `compression_controller`, `accuracy_aware_runner` and `save_dir` to it as arguments.
    The user can save the states of the objects according to their own needs. 
    `save_dir` is a directory that Accuracy-Aware pipeline created to store log information.
    '''
```

Once the above functions are defined, you could pass them to the `run` method of the earlier created training loop :
```python

model = training_loop.run(model,
                          train_epoch_fn=train_epoch_fn,
                          validate_fn=validate_fn,
                          configure_optimizers_fn=configure_optimizers_fn,
                          dump_checkpoint_fn=dump_checkpoint_fn)
```
The above call executes the acccuracy-aware training loop and return the compressed model. For more details on how to use the accuracy-aware training loop functionality of NNCF, please refer to its [documentation](./accuracy_aware_model_training/AdaptiveCompressionTraining.md).
