class PropagationBlock:
    """
    Defines a pruning block - how much and which particular channels are supposed to be pruned at the same time for
    the node when a single element of pruning mask is 0. We assume that the pruning mask is a vector with 1's and 0's.
    1 retains the corresponding set of channels in weights, 0 prunes it.
    The block is initialized on producers of pruning and is propagated until consumers within PropagationGroup and
    PropagationMask.
    Essentially, the propagation block is parametrized by size and offset. Size is the number of sequent channels to be
    included to the block. When offset is not equal to 0, the block is formed by taking the `size` number of
    sequent channels, then skipping the `offset` number of channels and repeating the procedure for the rest channels.

    Let's consider 3 possible examples.
    Notation:
    "-" is not a pruned channel
    "x" is a channel that is included to the block or pruned

    1) By default, a single element of structured pruning mask corresponds to a single channel in the producer.
    Size is equal to 1, offset is 0. It means that block consist of just 1 channel.

    size = 1
    offset = 0
    number of all channels = 18

    all channels                        ------------------
    block #1, mask: 011111111111111111  x-----------------

    2) But in some cases, pruning can be performed by set of channels, rather than individual one.
    For instance, head pruning in the Transformers is removal of N sequent channels, when N is the size of the
    head. In that case, the propagation block is encoded by size=N and offset=0.

    size = 6 (head size)
    offset = 0
    number of all channels = 18

    all channels           ------------------
    block #1, mask: 011    xxxxxx------------
    block #2, mask: 101    ------xxxxxx------
    block #3, mask: 110    ------------xxxxxx
    mask: 100              ------xxxxxxxxxxxx

    3) Or potentially, one can remove the same dimension in each Transformer's head. The propagation block would be as
    follows: size=1 and offset=N. It means that block is formed by taking the `size` number of sequent channels, then
    skipping the `offset` number of sequent channels and repeating the procedure for the rest channels. For that
    particular case, if total number of channels is 3N, the size of block will be equal to 3.
    Block will contain 6 elements, if size=2 offset=N with the same size of pruning mask.

    size = 1
    offset = 6 (head size)
    number of all channels = 18

    all channels              ------------------
    block #1, mask: 011111    x-----x-----x-----
    block #2, mask: 101111    -x-----x-----x----
    ...
    block #6, mask: 111110    -----x-----x-----x
