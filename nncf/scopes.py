class IgnoredScope:
    """
    Provides an option to specify portions of model to be excluded from compression.

    The ignored scope defines model sub-graphs that should be excluded from the compression process such as
    quantization, pruning and etc.

    Example:

    ..  code-block:: python

            import nncf

            # Exclude by node name:
            node_names = ['node_1', 'node_2', 'node_3']

            # Exclude using regular expressions:
            patterns = ['node_\\d']
            ignored_scope = nncf.IgnoredScope(patterns=patterns)

            # Exclude by operation type:

            # OpenVINO opset https://docs.openvino.ai/latest/openvino_docs_ops_opset.html
            operation_types = ['Multiply', 'GroupConvolution', 'Interpolate']

            operation_types = ['Mul', 'Conv', 'Resize']
            ignored_scope = nncf.IgnoredScope(types=operation_types)

    **Note:** Operation types must be specified according to the model framework.
