    Creates a post-training quantization pipeline.

    The post-training quantization pipeline includes the following steps:
        1) SmoothQuant
        2) ChannelAlignment
        3) MinMaxQuantization
        4) FastBiasCorrection or BiasCorrection

    :param preset: A preset controls the quantization mode (symmetric and asymmetric).
        It can take the following values:
        - `performance`: Symmetric quantization of weights and activations.
        - `mixed`: Symmetric quantization of weights and asymmetric quantization of activations.
        Default value is None. In this case, `mixed` preset is used for `transformer`
        model type otherwise `performace`.
    :param target_device: A target device the specificity of which will be taken
        into account while compressing in order to obtain the best performance
        for this type of device.
    :param subset_size: Size of a subset to calculate activations
        statistics used for quantization.
    :param fast_bias_correction: Setting this option to `False` enables a different
        bias correction method which is more accurate, in general, and takes
        more time but requires less memory.
    :param model_type: Model type is needed to specify additional patterns
        in the model. Supported only `transformer` now.
    :param ignored_scope: An ignored scope that defined the list of model control
        flow graph nodes to be ignored during quantization.
    :param advanced_parameters: Advanced quantization parameters for
        fine-tuning the quantization algorithm
    :return: A post-training quantization pipeline.
