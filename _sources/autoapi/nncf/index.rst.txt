.. py:function:: strip(model, *, do_copy = True, strip_format = StripFormat.NATIVE, example_input = None)

   Removes auxiliary layers and operations added during the compression process, resulting in a clean
   model ready for deployment. The functionality of the model object is still preserved as a compressed model.

   :param model: The compressed model.
   :param do_copy: If True (default), will return a copy of the currently associated model object. If False,
     will return the currently associated model object "stripped" in-place.
   :param strip format: Describes the format in which model is saved after strip.
   :param example_input: An example input tensor to be used for tracing the model.
   :return: The stripped model.


.. py:class:: NNCFConfig(*args, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dict`\ [\ :py:obj:`str`\ , :py:obj:`Any`\ ]

   Contains the configuration parameters required for NNCF to apply the selected algorithms.

   This is a regular dictionary object extended with some utility functions, such as the ability to attach well-defined
   structures to pass non-serializable objects as parameters. It is primarily built from a .json file, or from a
   Python JSON-like dictionary - both data types will be checked against a JSONSchema. See the definition of the
   schema at https://openvinotoolkit.github.io/nncf/schema/, or by calling NNCFConfig.schema().

   .. py:method:: from_dict(nncf_dict)
      :classmethod:

      Load NNCF config from a Python dictionary. The dict must contain only JSON-supported primitives.

      :param nncf_dict: A Python dict with the JSON-style configuration for NNCF.


   .. py:method:: from_json(path)
      :classmethod:

      Load NNCF config from a JSON file at `path`.

      :param path: Path to the .json file containing the NNCF configuration.


   .. py:method:: register_extra_structs(struct_list)

      Attach the supplied list of extra configuration structures to this configuration object.

      :param struct_list: List of extra configuration structures.


   .. py:method:: get_redefinable_global_param_value_for_algo(param_name, algo_name)

      Some parameters can be specified both on the global NNCF config .json level (so that they apply
      to all algos), and at the same time overridden in the algorithm-specific section of the .json.
      This function returns the value that should apply for a given algorithm name, considering the
      exact format of this config.

      :param param_name: The name of a parameter in the .json specification of the NNCFConfig, that may
        be present either at the top-most level of the .json, or at the top level of the algorithm-specific
        subdict.
      :param algo_name: The name of the algorithm (among the allowed algorithm names in the .json) for which
        the resolution of the redefinable parameter should occur.
      :return: The value of the parameter that should be applied for the algo specified by `algo_name`.


   .. py:method:: schema()
      :staticmethod:

      Returns the JSONSchema against which the input data formats (.json or Python dict) are validated.



.. py:class:: Dataset(data_source, transform_func = None)

   Wrapper for passing custom user datasets into NNCF algorithms.

   This class defines the interface by which compression algorithms
   retrieve data items from the passed data source object. These data items are used
   for different purposes, for example, model inference and model validation, based
   on the choice of the exact compression algorithm.

   If the data item has been returned from the data source per iteration and it cannot be
   used as input for model inference, the transformation function is used to extract the
   model's input from this data item. For example, in supervised learning, the data item
   usually contains both examples and labels. So transformation function should extract
   the examples from the data item.

   A special input key nncf.definitions.NNCF_DATASET_RESET_STATE_KEY can be used by OpenVINO backend to control
   resetting of internal model state between model inferences. This key can be added to a dataset sample input
   dictionary with either `True` or `False` value. With `True` value, the model state will be reset before inference
   on the corresponding sample, and with `False` the state will not be reset.

   :param data_source: The iterable object serving as the source of data items.
   :param transform_func: The function that is used to extract the model's input
       from the data item. The data item here is the data item that is returned from
       the data source per iteration. This function should be passed when
       the data item cannot be directly used as model's input. If this is not specified, then the data item
       will be passed into the model as-is.

   .. py:method:: get_data(indices = None)

      Returns the iterable object that contains selected data items from the data source as-is.

      :param indices: The zero-based indices of data items that should be selected from
          the data source. The indices should be sorted in ascending order. If indices are
          not passed all data items are selected from the data source.
      :return: The iterable object that contains selected data items from the data source as-is.


   .. py:method:: get_inference_data(indices = None)

      Returns the iterable object that contains selected data items from the data source, for which
      the transformation function was applied. The item, which was returned per iteration from this
      iterable, can be used as the model's input for model inference.

      :param indices: The zero-based indices of data items that should be selected from
          the data source. The indices should be sorted in ascending order. If indices are
          not passed all data items are selected from the data source.
      :return: The iterable object that contains selected data items from the data source, for which
          the transformation function was applied.


   .. py:method:: get_length()

      Tries to fetch length of the underlying dataset.
      :return: The length of the data_source if __len__() is implemented for it, and None otherwise.


   .. py:method:: get_batch_size()

      Tries to fetch batch size of the underlying dataset.
      :return: The value of batch_size or _batch_size attributes of the data_source if exist, and None otherwise.



.. py:class:: BackupMode

   Bases: :py:obj:`StrEnum`

       In this mode, weights are retained in their original precision without any quantization.
   :param INT8_SYM: Stands for 8-bit integer symmetric quantization without zero point.

   :param INT8_ASYM: Stands for 8-bit integer asymmetric quantization with a typical non-fixed zero point.
       https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/Quantization.md#asymmetric-quantization


.. py:class:: CompressionFormat

   Bases: :py:obj:`StrEnum`

   Describes the format in which the model is saved after weight compression.

   :param DQ: Represents the 'dequantize' format, where weights are stored in low-bit precision,
       and a dequantization subgraph is added to the model. This is the default format for post-training weight
       compression methods.
   :param FQ: Represents the 'fake_quantize' format, where quantization is simulated by applying
       quantization and dequantization operations. Weights remain in the same precision. This format is
       suitable for quantization-aware training (QAT).
   :param FQ_LORA: Represents the 'fake_quantize_with_lora' format, which combines fake quantization
       with absorbable low-rank adapters (LoRA). Quantization is applied to the sum of weights and
       the multiplication of adapters. This makes quantization-aware training (QAT) more efficient in terms of
       accuracy, as adapters can also be tuned and remain computationally affordable during training due to their
       small dimensions.
   :param FQ_LORA_NLS: Represents the 'fake_quantize_with_lora_nls' format, which extends FQ_LORA with elastic
       absorbable low-rank adapters (LoRA). Quantization is applied similarly to FQ_LORA, and utilizing NLS often
       results in better performance for downstream task fine-tuning.

       with a typical non-fixed zero point.
       https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/compression_algorithms/Quantization.md#asymmetric-quantization
   :param INT4_SYM: Stands for a mixed-precision weights quantization with 4-bit integer as a primary precision.
       Weights are quantized to a primary precision symmetrically without zero point.
       All embeddings and the last layer are always compressed to a backup precision, which is INT8_ASYM,
       by default. All others are quantized whether to 4-bit integer or to a backup precision depending on
       criteria and the given ratio.
       https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf/blob/develop/docs/usage/training_time_compression/other_algorithms/LegacyQuantization.md#symmetric-quantization
   :param INT4_ASYM: The same as INT4_SYM mode, but weights are quantized to a primary precision asymmetrically
       with a typical non-fixed zero point.

   :param CB4_F8E4M3: Codebook (LUT) format with 16 fixed fp8 values in E4M3 format.


.. py:class:: DropType

   Bases: :py:obj:`StrEnum`

   str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str

   Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or

   Defines a sensitivity metric for assigning quantization precision to layers. In order to
       preserve the accuracy of the model, the more sensitive layers receives a higher precision.

   :param WEIGHT_QUANTIZATION_ERROR: The inverted 8-bit quantization noise. Weights with highest value
       of this metric can be accurately quantized channel-wise to 8-bit. The idea is to leave these weights in 8bit,
       and quantize the rest of layers to 4-bit group-wise. Since group-wise is more accurate than per-channel,

   operations added during the compression process, resulting in a clean model ready for deployment.
   The functionality of the model object is still preserved as a compressed model.

   :param NATIVE: Preserves as many custom NNCF additions as possible in the model.
   :param DQ: Replaces FakeQuantize operations with a dequantization subgraph and stores compressed weights
       in low-bit precision using fake quantize parameters. This is the default format for deploying models
       with compressed weights.
   :param IN_PLACE: Directly applies NNCF operations to the weights, replacing the original weights.

.. py:class:: OverflowFix

   Bases: :py:obj:`nncf.parameters.StrEnum`

   This option controls whether to apply the overflow issue fix for the 8-bit
   quantization.

   8-bit instructions of older Intel CPU generations (based on SSE, AVX-2, and AVX-512
   instruction sets) suffer from the so-called saturation (overflow) issue: in some
   configurations, the output does not fit into an intermediate buffer and has to be
   clamped. This can lead to an accuracy drop on the aforementioned architectures.
   The fix set to use only half a quantization range to avoid overflow for specific
   operations.

   If you are going to infer the quantized model on the architectures with AVX-2, and
   AVX-512 instruction sets, we recommend using FIRST_LAYER option as lower aggressive
   fix of the overflow issue. If you still face significant accuracy drop, try using
   ENABLE, but this may get worse the accuracy.

   :param ENABLE: All weights of all types of Convolutions and MatMul operations
       are be quantized using a half of the 8-bit quantization range.
   :param FIRST_LAYER: Weights of the first Convolutions of each model inputs
       are quantized using a half of the 8-bit quantization range.
   :param DISABLE: All weights are quantized using the full 8-bit quantization range.

           # Exclude by node name:
           node_names = ['node_1', 'node_2', 'node_3']

.. py:class:: Subgraph

   Defines the ignored subgraph as follows: A subgraph comprises all nodes along
   all simple paths in the graph from input to output nodes.

   :param inputs: Input node names.
   :type inputs: List[str]
   :param outputs: Output node names.
   :type outputs: List[str]
