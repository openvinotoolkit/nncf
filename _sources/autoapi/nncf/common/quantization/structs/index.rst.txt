   Bases: :py:obj:`nncf.parameters.StrEnum`

   Enumeration for specifying quantization schemes.

   :param SYMMETRIC: Symmetric quantization where the range is defined by a single parameter - scale.
       This range can include both negative and positive values if signed, or only positive values if unsigned.
   :param ASYMMETRIC: Asymmetric quantization where the range is defined by two parameters - input_low and input_high,
       representing the lower and upper boundaries of the range, respectively.
   :param SYMMETRIC_LORA: Symmetric quantization with Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA), involving the sum of weights and
       the multiplication of low-rank adapters.
   :param SYMMETRIC_LORA_NLS: Symmetric quantization with Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) and Neural Low-Rank Adapter Search
       (NLS), involving the sum of weights and the multiplication of low-rank adapters.
   :param ASYMMETRIC_LORA: Asymmetric quantization with Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA), involving the sum of weights and
       the multiplication of low-rank adapters.
   :param ASYMMETRIC_LORA_NLS: Asymmetric quantization with Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) and Neural Low-Rank Adapter Search
       (NLS), involving the sum of weights and the multiplication of low-rank adapters.
