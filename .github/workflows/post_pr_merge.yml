# With the squash-and-merge strategy that we are employing, the final commit that ends up in the develop branch
# after the PR merge has a brand-new commit SHA that is not equal to the SHA of the last commit in the PR.
# This means that the coverage reports uploaded to Codecov in the course of the (yet unmerged) PR checks will not
# be translated to the ultimate commit in the develop and Codecov will show "missing base report" errors in the UI.
# We don't want to re-run the precommits after PR merge via a separate 'on: push' action on the develop branch, so
# instead will grab the latest coverage report artifact from the just-merged PR and upload it as the report for the
# new commit on develop. Note that this will break if the PR is merged before the coverage artifact for the latest
# PR commit is generated.
